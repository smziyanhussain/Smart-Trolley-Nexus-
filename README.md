SmartTrolley Nexus – AI-Powered Smart Shopping Cart
📌 Project Overview

SmartTrolley Nexus is a Final Year Project (FYP) developed to automate the shopping and billing process using Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision. The system uses a camera and machine learning techniques to identify products placed inside a shopping trolley and automatically generate a bill.

The primary objective of this project is to reduce checkout time, eliminate long queues, and provide a smart shopping experience for customers.

⚙️ System Workflow
Customer places a product inside the trolley.
Camera captures the product image.
TensorFlow model identifies the product.
Product information is retrieved from the database.
Product price is added to the bill.
If the product is not found:
User is prompted to add product information.
Product image and price are stored for future recognition.
Updated bill is displayed automatically.
🧠 Machine Learning Model

The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on product images.

Training Process
Collect product images.
Organize images into class folders.
Train CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
Export trained model as:
model.h5

for Raspberry Pi deployment.
